#Task 1: Sales Forecasting

#Description
I initially partitioned the sales data into separate training and testing sets. Subsequently, I conducted a comprehensive range of analyses exclusively on the training dataset. Following this, a judicious selection process led to the exclusion of superfluous columns. Subsequent to column pruning, I executed label encoding to facilitate the conversion of string-based data into a numerical format. Additionally, I further partitioned the processed training data into distinct training and testing subsets, a step taken to assess the performance accuracy of the model. In terms of modeling, both linear regression and random forest methodologies were employed. Notably, the random forest technique yielded notably superior accuracy results, thus emerging as the preferred choice.
